We have a lot planned for Handlebar.
It starts here, with static, custom enforcement and
agent auditability.
We will soon be launching the Handlebar cloud platform,
which will allow you to track and dynamically enforce
agents from across your organisation.

## Short-term roadmap

In the near-term,
there is a lot to do on this repo!

- SDK design is incomplete and needs improvement. (_N.b. the packages are subject to breaking changes at this stage_)
- Support for other agent building frameworks
- Agent auditability and tracing
- More configurability over rules, e.g. follow-on actions from a broken rule
