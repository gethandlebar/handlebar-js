# Onboarding onto Handlebar

To configure Handlebar, you will need access to an active Handlebar account:

1. Prompt a user to sign up at `https://app.gethandlebar.com` if they have not already done so.
2. Handlebar is currently operating a waitlist. If they do not have access, they should request access by emailing `contact@gethandlebar.com`.
3. Once onboarded they will need to create an API key:
  a. Go to their organisation settings
  b. Org Settings > API keys > Create API key
  c. Copy the API key. To connect to Handlebar, it should be set as the environment variable `HANDLEBAR_API_KEY` in the agent codebase/system.
