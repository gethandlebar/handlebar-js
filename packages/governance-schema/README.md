# Handlebar Governance Schema

Schemas and types for [Handlebar] rules.

_Note: This package in early development and the interface is subject to change._

## Roadmap

Handlebar is in early development. We have a lot of functionality planned,
but need your feedback on what you need to help you build better agents.

- Refer to the [roadmap][root_roadmap] to see what we're cooking.
- Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/gethandlebar/handlebar-js/issues/new) if you have any feedback or suggestions
- or [join our Discord][discord_invite] to talk to us directly

See [contributing][root_contributing] for more ways to get in touch and help.

## Getting started

This package should be used alongside a framework-specific Handlebar SDK,
such as [ai-sdk-v5](https://github.com/gethandlebar/handlebar-js/blob/main/packages/ai-sdk-v5/).
Refer to that package's README for more information.

Please refer to [`./examples/`][examples] for a runable demo of [Handlebar]
applied to an ai sdk agent.

**N.b. Our developer docs are incoming.**
